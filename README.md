[Website Here!](https://reecesmith14.github.io/Personal-Portfolio-Website/)

This is my primary hub for showcasing my skills and projects to potential employers. This portfolio website was crafted with a user-centric approach, utilising the framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), languages such as [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) & [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and libraries & programs including [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## UX (User Experience) Design

### Developer Goals

As a developer my goals are to:

- Practice and refine existing skills.
- Learn new skills through problem-solving and collaborating.
- Attract potential employers.

### Employer/Recruiter/Collaborator Goals

A potential employer/collaborator will want to:

- Quickly identify suitable candidates.
- Gain a understanding of a candidate's skills, experiences.
- Easily reach out to potential candidates for further discussions.
- Evaluate whether a candidate will fit well into the company culture.
- Gain insights into your collaboration and communication style.

### User Stories

As a potential employer, client or collaborator I want:

- Quickly understand the purpose of the portfolio website.
- Navigate easily with a user-friendly layout.
- Assess the developer's skills and experiences.
- Learn about the developer through an engaging 'About Me' section.
- Access external profiles like LinkedIn or GitHub for more information.
- Find easily accessible contact information.


### Design Decisions

#### Colours

- The primary colour for the website is Hex: #2B2B2B. This dark colour was choosen as I typically operate my IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) in night mode and this colour reminded me of that.
- A secondary colour of Hex: #555555 is used to create contrast between the sections of the page.
- Text is to be Hex: #FFFFFF to give the best contrast.
- Links will show as Hex: #3498db when hovered over and change to Hex: #e74c3c when clicked to provide user feedback.

#### Typography

- The page title, page scroll prompts and buttons used the serif font "Merriweather". This is the only time this is being used so it will stnad our from all other text.
- Vast majority of text was written in the sans-serif font "Roboto". This is a simple clean font that is easy to read.

#### Icons

- Most icons will be white to improve contrast and were either company logos or globally regonised symbols for what they were representing. E.g [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) logo being used for a link to a linkedin page.
- Some of the arrow scroll prompts will be black to create a contrast to the text that is linked to it.

#### Images

- As the webiste is a personal portfolio, portaits with no background have been used.
- For the projects, screen shots / mock-ups have been used. If the images are clicked a tab will open to the GitHub repository will open up.

## Features

### Existing Features

1. Fixed Navigation Bar

    - Navigation bar fixed to the top of the screen with links so no matter where you are on the page you can always just to another section.
    - Navigation bar includes links to the three sections: About, Projects and Contact.
    - I have also included links to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/)

2. About Section

    - This sections includes a brief description of the technogies that I can use so that potetnial employers and collaborators can have a quick overview of my skill set.
    - A "Contact Me" button is found at the bottom of this section to allow the user to quickly be able ot jump to that section after reading about me.

### Left to Implement

1. Smooth scrolling when a page link is clicked. This feature currently doesn't work and I'm not entirly sure why. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
2. Scroll down prompts which will be animated to bounce at the bottom of each section. I'm currently struggling with the positions of these elements so again any feedback would be appreciated.
