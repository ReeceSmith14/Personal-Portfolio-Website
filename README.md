[Website Here!]()

This is my primary hub for showcasing my skills and projects to potential employers. This portfolio website was crafted with a user-centric approach, utilising the framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), languages such as [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and libraries & programs including [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## UX (User Experience) Design

### Developer Goals

As a developer my goals are to:

- Practice and refine existing skills.
- Learn new skills through problem-solving and collaborating.
- Attract potential employers.

### Employer/Recruiter/Collaborator Goals

A potential employer/collaborator will want to:

- Quickly identify suitable candidates.
- Gain a understanding of a candidate's skills, experiences.
- Easily reach out to potential candidates for further discussions.
- Evaluate whether a candidate will fit well into the company culture.
- Gain insights into your collaboration and communication style.

### User Stories

As a potential employer, client or collaborator I want:

- Quickly understand the purpose of the portfolio website.
- Navigate easily with a user-friendly layout.
- Assess the developer's skills and experiences.
- Learn about the developer through an engaging 'About Me' section.
- Access external profiles like LinkedIn or GitHub for more information.
- Find easily accessible contact information.


### Design Decisions

#### Colours

- The primary colour for the website is Hex: #2B2B2B. This dark colour was choosen as I typically operate my IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) in night mode and this colour reminded me of that.
- A secondary colour of Hex: #555555 is used to create contrast between the sections of the page.
- Text is to be Hex: #FFFFFF to give the best contrast.
- Links will show as Hex: #3498db when hovered over and change to Hex: #e74c3c when clicked to provide user feedback.

#### Typography

- The page title, page scroll prompts and buttons used the serif font "Merriweather". This is the only time this is being used so it will stnad our from all other text.
- Vast majority of text was written in the sans-serif front "Roboto". This is a simple clean font that is easy to read.

#### Icons

- Most icons will be white to improve contrast and were either company logos or globally regonised symbols for what they were representing. E.g [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) logo being used for a link to a linkedin page.
- Some of the arrow scroll prompts will be black to create a contrast to the text that is linked to it.

#### Images

- As the webiste is a personal portfolio, portaits with no background have been used.
- For the projects, screen shots / mock-ups have been used. If the images are clicked a tab will open to the GitHub repository will open up.
