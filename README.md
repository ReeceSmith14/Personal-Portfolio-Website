<h1 align="center" style="font-size:40px; font-family:serif;">Reece Smith - Personal Portfolio</h1>

[Website Here!](https://reecesmith14.github.io/Personal-Portfolio-Website/)

This mock website represents my primary hub for showcasing my skills and projects to potential employers. It was crafted with a user-centric approach, utilising the framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), languages such as [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) & [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and libraries & programs including [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## UX (User Experience) Design

### Strategy

Goal: The goal of the project is to design a mock personal portfolio website that attracts potential employers, recruiters, collaborators and clients.

Approach: The website focuses on showcasing various technologies used, demonstrated within the site and mock-up projects. These projects are currently empty containing only an index.html, however, as I continue to learn and build these will be populated.

Rationale: Recruiters want to know about potential employees' skills, experience, and projects. They expect this information to be easy to find and clear on their websites. Because recruiters look at many sites each day, mine needs to be easy to use and visually appealing to stand out.

Strategy: The website should showcase the technologies I can use, and the skills I possess in an interesting way to keep recruiters and employers engaged. Ultimately the goal is steer them towards the "Contact" section.

### Scope

#### Functions and features that are within the scope

- Landing header to summarise the website and provide easy navigation to all other sections
- About me section to summarise my experience and skills
- Projects section to give an overview of my work.
- Contact section to allow employers, collaborators and clients to connect and ask quetions.

At everystage of the design the main focus is driving traffic towars the contact section or social media links.

### Design Decisions

#### Colours

- The primary colours for the website are Hex: #0A2239 and Hex:#132E32 . This dark colour was choosen as I typically operate my IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) in night mode and these colour reminded me of that.
- Secondary colours of Hex: #53A2BE and Hex:#1D84B5 are used to create contrast between the sections of the page.
- The text is mostly white with the navbar in black as this give the best contrasts.
- Navbar links show as Hex: #53A2BE, contact me button shows as HEX: #53A2BE with a background colour of white and project links show as black when hovered over

#### Typography

- The navbar, about section heading and  project titles all used the display font "Barriecito". As these are the only time this is being used so it will stnad our from all other text.
- Vast majority of text was written in the sans-serif font "Open Sans". This is a simple clean font that is easy to read.

#### Icons

- Icons will be either white or blacking depending on what provides the best contrast.
- Either company logos or globally regonised symbols for what they were representing are used to meet the users expectations. E.g [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) logo being used for a link to a linkedin page.

#### Images

- As the webiste is a personal portfolio, portaits with no background have been used.
- For the projects, code snippet screen shots have been used. If the images are clicked a tab will open to the associated GitHub repository. PLEASE NOTE: Pictures of my dog have been used as placeholder for these images as these projects don't currently exist.

## Features

### Existing Features

1. Fixed Navigation Bar

    - Navigation bar fixed to the top of the screen with links so no matter where you are on the page you can always just to another section.
    - Navigation bar includes links to the three sections: About, Projects and Contact.
    - I have also included links to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/)

2. About Section

    - This sections includes a brief description of the technologies that I can use so that potetnial employers and collaborators can have a quick overview of my skill set.
    - A "Contact Me" button is found at the bottom of this section to allow the user to quickly be able ot jump to that section after reading about me.

### Left to Implement

1. Scroll down prompts which will be animated to bounce at the bottom of each section. I'm currently struggling with the positions of these elements so any feedback would be appreciated.
2. Projects section should include screenshots of code snippets that when clicked take you to the respective GitHub repository, rather than cute pictures of my dog.
3. Social media links don't currently go to my pages. These pages are yet to be finished so didn't want to link to something that wasn't complete.
4. Link contact form at the bottom of the page to either a database or triggers an automated email that sends me the message and contact details.
